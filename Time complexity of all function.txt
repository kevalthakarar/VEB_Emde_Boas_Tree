O(log(log(u)) functions T(u) = T(u^(1/2)) + O(1)
  
  VEB_Tree_Member(x) - only one recurrence with size root(u)
  VEB_Tree_Insert(x) - cluster is empty the update summary table one recursive call then update cluster maximum and minimum constant operation
  VEB_Tree_Succesor(x) - using Max if value in his own cluster if not look in the summary
  VEB_Tree_Predecesoor(x) same as above but using Min
  VEB_Tree_Delete(x)  - When we update summary at that time delete recursive is contant time just delete min max
